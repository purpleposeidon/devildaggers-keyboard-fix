# To install
1. Make sure you have gdb installed. You'll have to use your system's package manager, I don't know the specifics of this.
2. Open up a terminal.
3. Paste in:

    `curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/purpleposeidon/devildaggers-keyboard-fix/master/install-using-steam.sh | bash`

4. Press enter.
5. Devil Daggers should start, and then exit abruptly.
6. Then it'll start again, and then the fix should be there.
6. Verify that the fix works by mashing W and A at the same time.

# To uninstall/if something breaks:
1. Go to your Steam library
2. Find Devil Daggers in the game list
3. Right click DD entry -> Properties -> Local Files
4. Click "VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES..."
